<p><img src="/img/csc305finalproject.jpg" alt="Introducing the application schedulizer with screenshots of the apps." />
Our team wanted to build a fully functional courses schedule app that helps students and falcuty easily manage and visualize the courses and make better decisions.</p>

<h2 id="our-members-from-the-business-team">Our members from the Business Team</h2>

<p>Hint: Why would we name out team “Business”? Because it’s a class joke at the begining of the year since there is a group named the “Human” Team so we go with the name of a project class “Business”.</p>

<p>From the left to right, we have Max, Viet, Hubert, and Ryan.
I love all of them, and I have the best experience ever to work in a group.</p>
