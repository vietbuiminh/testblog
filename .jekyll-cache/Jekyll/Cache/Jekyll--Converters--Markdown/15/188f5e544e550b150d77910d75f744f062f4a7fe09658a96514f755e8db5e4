<p><img src="/img/javaFX.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the running application on eclipse" /></p>

<p>With limited instruction on the first class, getting a ghost file to run the JavaFX is quiet a journey to me. The Google sources from the other instructors are not quiet compatitble with my Eclipse and the detailed information that I was looking. If you also in that place, then this article would be a fresh breeze for your whole general idea of setting up the JavaFX Application on your Eclipse.
This short guide would work best for PC, but Mac user can use the general step for their own device!</p>

<h2 id="does-your-pc-has-the-available-ide-java-and-javafx-library">Does your PC has the available IDE, Java, and JavaFX library?</h2>

<p>First make sure that you have those 3 items on your system.</p>

<p>– Use Oracle Webpage to download Java <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank" class="link hover-underline-animation">link here</a></p>

<p>– Getting JavaFX on the Openjfx <a href="https://openjfx.io/" target="_blank" class="link hover-underline-animation">link here</a>. Make sure to save it in a folder that you can later access (this will be important for the further guide)</p>
