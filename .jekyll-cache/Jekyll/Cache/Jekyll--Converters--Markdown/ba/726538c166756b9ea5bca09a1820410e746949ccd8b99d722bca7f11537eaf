<p><img src="/img/art-cover.png" alt="A Series of computer generated shapes in the form of natural sequence Fibonacci" /></p>

<p>The fascinating mathematic structures, the patterns derived from nature related to the renowned Fibonacci, and the spiral Phyllotaxis. The artwork was created using Netlogo3D with raytracing and x3d extensions. This piece is my Final Project for CSC150.</p>
