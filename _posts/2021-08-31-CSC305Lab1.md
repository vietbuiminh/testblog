description: With limited instruction on the first class, getting a ghost file to run the JavaFX is quiet a journey to me. The Google sources from the other instructors are not quiet compatitble with my Eclipse and the detailed information that I was looking. If you also in that place, then this article would be a fresh breeze for your whole general idea of setting up the JavaFX Application on your Eclipse.

This short guide would work best for PC, but Mac user can use the general step for their own device!

## Does your PC has the available IDE, Java, and JavaFX library?

First make sure that you have those 3 items on your system.

-- Use Oracle Webpage to download Java <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank" class="link hover-underline-animation">link here</a>

-- Getting JavaFX on the Openjfx <a href="https://openjfx.io/" target="_blank" class="link hover-underline-animation">link here</a>. Make sure to save it in a folder that you can later access (this will be important for the further guide)

-- Download and install the latest EclipseIDE! <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank" class="link hover-underline-animation">link here</a>

## Set up the JavaFX on Eclipse

Navigate the top bar menu

Help > Eclipse Marketplace...

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx1.JPG" | relative_url }})

Go to the search bar and type "fx", hit ENTER. The first option should be "e(fx)clipse", and hit INSTALL.
Let it run and restart.

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx2.JPG" | relative_url }})

After that open the IDE again. Go to File > New > Project

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx3.JPG" | relative_url }})

Select a wizard should pop up and you want to find JavaFX > JavaFX Project.

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx4.JPG" | relative_url }})

Name the new project like "FirstJavaFXApplication" perhaps.
Remember to not create Module!!!

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx5.JPG" | relative_url }})

Then right click on the file in the Package window > Properties

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx6.JPG" | relative_url }})

Nagivate to Java Build Path, and select the Modulepath. Select Add External JARs...

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx7.JPG" | relative_url }})

A window should pop up and you should navigate to the folder that you got from JavaFX that you downloaded and unzipped before.
Head to javafx-sdk-11.0.2 > lib.

Choose all the .jar files. ENTER

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx8.JPG" | relative_url }})

Click Apply and Close

![{{ javafx1 }}]({{ "/img/writing/javafx9.JPG" | relative_url }})

Go to src > application > Main.java. Run the program, screenshoot the thing for your professor.
