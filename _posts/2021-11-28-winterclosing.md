### Residence Hall will close for Winter Break from

#### ✅ noon Saturday, December 11 ➡️ noon Sunday, January 2

This time frame is for first year students who enrolled in J-term.

⚠️ NOTE: ResLife staffs will be going to rooms on the 11th to do health and safety check 😬

### Wait! What if I want to stay on campus during the break? 🤔

You can stay on campus if you are:

-- 🌐International students <br>
-- 🌎Domestic students whose home address if >= 400 miles from campus<br>
-- 🏅Athletes who are required to be on campus in order to participate<br>
-- 💪Students who are needed to work in an on-campus jobs

## Do this before leaving or else......

-- Remove food from communal kitchens. Stuff will be thrown away 😿<br>
-- Make sure there is no clothes in the laundery room<br>
-- 💧<strong>DEFROST FRIDGES / FREEZERS 24 hours</strong> ⏱️ prior to leaving (trust me, you need to do this or it will be a mess and stressfull experience while panic packing to move) <br>
-- If you have fishes, bring them home. They will die of starving if you leave them here🐟<br>
-- Lock the windows<br>
-- Trash remove and taken to the OUTSIDE Dumpster (if I saw the bathroom's trashbins filled up again, we will have fine for the whole wing, my friends)<br>
-- Unplug all electrical appliances<br>
-- Lock the door upon exiting room<br>
-- Sign the paper slip on your door when you leave and taped to the door 📜📎

## ....then you are good to go
