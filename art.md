        The fascinating mathematic structures, the patterns derived from nature related to the renowned Fibonacci, and the spiral Phyllotaxis. The artwork was created using Netlogo3D with raytracing and x3d extensions. This piece is my Final Project for CSC150.

        Inspired by the foliage and the flora of the rain forest of the state of Washington. One of the
        centerpieces of the artwork is the fern feature. The ferns are the characteristic of the
        all-year-round rain. The rain always brings up the scent of the wooded forest. Every piece in the
        artwork reminds me of every hike through the wood.
